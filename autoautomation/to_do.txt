Aim:
Create a working automation workflow on the n8n website based on the task described in a single text file.

Input:
A text file named project.txt containing a natural language description of the automation task

Output:
A complete and functional n8n workflow created directly on the n8n website GUI. This includes nodes, configurations, connections, and all necessary settings.

Process:

Interpret Task:
Read the contents of project.txt and understand the user's automation requirements. Break the task into modular steps such as input, processing, and output.
Design Workflow Logic:
Determine:
Which n8n nodes are required (e.g., Webhook, Set, HTTP Request, Function, Google Sheets)
How these nodes should be connected
The sequence of actions and any required conditions, loops, or waits
Execute on n8n Website:
Open the n8n editor (cloud or self-hosted instance) and simulate the following:
Click to create a new workflow
Add and configure each node based on the logic
Set node parameters and field values
Connect nodes to define data flow
Configure credentials or prompt the user if authentication is required
Implement pagination, loops, or conditional paths if specified
Save the final workflow
Finalize:
Ensure the workflow is functional and reflects all steps in the task description. Validate the setup and save it on the platform.

Constraints:

All steps must be performed through the n8n website UI by simulating user actions (no CLI or API).
Assume the user is logged into n8n and credentials are pre-configured if needed.
Do not prompt for unnecessary confirmations or messages. Focus on completing the flow as described.
